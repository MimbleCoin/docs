## How to keep my coins in the HODL Programm

  There are alot of questions about how the HODL Programm works and how to make sure registered coins keep HODL'ing.
  Let's try to provide one easy explanation: 
  
  1) As long as you don't move your coins you registered you are fine! 
  
  That's all. It's as easy as that.
  
  Many People create a second Wallet Instance and only use this second instance after they registered their funds to HODL. 
  This way they are making sure they don't touch their HODL'ed funds. 
  
  Creating a second Instance will create a new Wallet, so make sure to backup the Seed phrase! 
  You can Read up on how to do this [here](create_Instance_qt-wallet.md)

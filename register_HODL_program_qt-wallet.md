## How to keep my coins in the HODL Program

  There are alot of questions about how to make sure registered coins keep HODL'ing.
  Let's try to provide one easy explanation: 
  
	1) As long as you don't move your coins you registered you are fine! 
  
  That's all. It's as easy as that.
  
  Many People create a second Wallet Instance and only use this second instance after they registered their funds to HODL. 
  This way they are making sure they don't touch their HODL'ed funds. 
  
  Creating a second Instance will create a new Wallet, so make sure to backup the Seed phrase!<br />

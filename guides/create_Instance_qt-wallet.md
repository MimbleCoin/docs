# Managing Instances in the QT Wallet

  To make sure you are seperating different Amounts of MWC you can create different Instances. 
  This is recommended to ensure you don't accidentally spend any of your HODL'ed Outputs. 
  
  Creating an instance is similar to creating a new wallet with it's own Seed, but you can switch between them in the same GUI without a big struggle.
  Also Instead of having 2 Installations of the QT Wallet in place the Data of the new Instance can be saved in the same Folder as the default one.

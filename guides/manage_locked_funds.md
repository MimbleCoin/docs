# Managing Outputs and locking them to prevent spending

  To make sure you are are not spending different MWC Outputs you can lock them individually. 
  This is recommended to ensure you don't accidentally spend any of your HODL'ed Outputs. 
  If you want to spend your HODL rewards but are worried to move your HODL Funds, make sure to lock them. 
  
  
  To use this feature we need to enable it first before we can lock wanted Outputs. <br>
  **Make sure you are on Version 1.0.18 or above**

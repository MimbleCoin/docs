# Overview #

This page describes a scope of work for the Bitcoin twitter bot which will allow users to subscribe to a twitter account and
regularly get updates on the price of Bitcoin. It is intended to be extended later to have more price data from other
cryptocurrencies, but this is the first task.

# Features #

Configurable values for the following:

1.) Frequency of tweets: Need to be able to easily configure how often price tweets are sent out.

2.) Template of tweets: Need to be able to easily configure what the message says and include varaibles for BTC price data.

3.) Price feeds: Need to be able to decide where price data comes from.

# Estimated Timeline #

To be provided by developer.

# Acceptance Criteria / Testing #

We will run the twitter bot in production for a few days and report any issues and once fixed and confirmed the twitter bot
will be considered accepted.
